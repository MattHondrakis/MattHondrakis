### Datasets I found most interesting:   
  1. [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYCHousePrices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      *  **GAM**, **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** models, predicting prices of Real Estate properties in NYC. The type of property (Condo, Apartment, etc.)
         is extracted from the *home_details* variable, which plays a crucial role in the modeling process. Models are then compared against eachother by key metrics,            such as R<sup>2</sup> and Root Mean Squared Error.
  2. [Job Placement](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Masters%20Project%20Fall%20Placement/Masters-Project-Fall-Placement.md)  *(DataAnalysis)*
      *  Validated data by checking for and appropriately dealing with missing values and outliers. Explored trends and correlations between different 
         variables, utilizing visualizations and statistical tests. Subquently, created two models (**Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**) 
         predicting whether an individual received a job offer with the best modelâ€™s values for accuracy and AUC being 0.853 and 0.932, respectively. Finally, 
         analyzed the *variable importance* of each predictor in both models and compared. 
  3. [Coursera Case Study: Bikes](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Coursera%20Case%20Study/Bikes.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      *  Google Analytics Case Study (fictional company *Cyclistic*), analyzing a large dataset of more than **6 million** rows of data using R to extract 
         insights. 
         The purpose of the Case Study is to get casual users to convert to memberships. Thorough exploratory data analysis with a conclusion providing suggestions for            improvement and steps moving forward.
  4. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)* 
      *  **One of the first real world datasets I ever worked on.**
      *  **Logistic Regression** model predicting whether a drink is a *Frappuccino* based on sodium (mg). The status of 'Frappuccino' is extracted 
         from the name of the drink using text manipulation.


Most Recent/Actively working on: 
* [Final Project: Job Placement](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Masters%20Project%20Fall%20Placement/Masters-Project-Fall-Placement.md) *(DataAnalysis)*


Note: I tend to jump from one dataset to the next!
