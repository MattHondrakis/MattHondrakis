### Datasets I found most interesting:   
  1. [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYCHousePrices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      * **GAM**, **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** models, predicting prices of Real Estate properties in NYC. The type of property (Condo, Apartment, etc.)           is extracted from the *home_details* variable, which plays a crucial role in the modeling process. Models are then compared against eachother by key metrics,           such as R<sup>2</sup> and Root Mean Squared Error.
  2. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)*
      * **Logistic regression model** predicting whether a drink is a Frappuccino based on sodium (mg). The status of 'Frappuccino' is extracted 
        from the name of the drink using text manipulation.
  3. [Heart](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/01-06-22/heart.md)  *(First-Git)*
      * Comparison of 2 **logistic regression models**, predicting heart disease. The first model uses all variables as predictors and the second model 
        uses the 4 most influential variables. 
  4. [Coursera Case Study: Bikes](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Coursera%20Case%20Study/Bikes.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      * Google Analytics Case Study (fictional company *Cyclistic*), analyzing a large dataset of more than **6 million** rows of data using R to extract insights. The purpose of the Case Study is to get casual users to convert to memberships. Thorough exploratory data analysis with a conclusion providing suggestions for improvement and steps moving forward.
