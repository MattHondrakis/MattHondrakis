- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MattHondrakis
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m interested in Probability/Statistics, Actuarial Science, and Data Science.
- ðŸŒ± I received a Data Scientist Associate Certification from DataCamp and Google Data Analytics Certificate from Coursera.
- :trophy: I have a BS in Applied Mathematics from The City College of New York.

## Datasets I found most interesting:   
ðŸ§© => Structured Analysis     
ðŸ’« => Unstructered Chronological Analysis     
ðŸ’» => Machine Learning Model     

  1. [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYCHousePrices.md) *(DataAnalysis)* ðŸ’« ðŸ’»
      *  **GAM**, **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** models, predicting prices of Real Estate properties in NYC. The type of property (Condo, Apartment, etc.)
         is extracted from the *home_details* variable, which plays a crucial role in the modeling process. Models are then compared against eachother by key metrics,            such as <ins>R<sup>2</sup></ins> and <ins>Root Mean Squared Error</ins>.
  2. [Job Placement](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Masters%20Project%20Job%20Placement/Masters-Project-Fall-Placement.md) *(DataAnalysis)* ðŸ§© ðŸ’»
      *  Validated data by checking for and appropriately dealing with missing values and outliers. Explored trends and correlations between different 
         variables, utilizing visualizations and statistical tests. Subquently, created two models (**Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**) 
         predicting whether an individual received a job offer, with the best modelâ€™s values for <ins>*accuracy*</ins> and <ins>*AUC*</ins> being 0.853 and 0.932, respectively. Finally, 
         analyzed the *variable importance* of each predictor in both models and compared. 
  3. [Coursera Case Study: Bikes](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Coursera%20Case%20Study/Bikes.md) *(DataAnalysis)* ðŸ§©
      *  Google Analytics Case Study (fictional company *Cyclistic*), analyzing a large dataset of more than **6 million** rows of data using R to extract 
         insights. 
         The purpose of the Case Study is to get casual users to convert to memberships. Thorough exploratory data analysis with a conclusion providing suggestions for            improvement and steps moving forward.
  4. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)* ðŸ’« ðŸ’»
      *  **One of the first real world datasets I ever worked on.**
      *  **Logistic Regression** model predicting whether a drink is a *Frappuccino* based on sodium (mg). The status of 'Frappuccino' is extracted 
         from the name of the drink using text manipulation.


## Most Recent/Actively working on: 

Analyses are usually done in <ins>**R**</ins> but sometimes replicated in <ins>**Python**</ins>

### Dataset: <ins>Tech Stock Prices</ins>
   - [R](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Tech%20Stock%20Prices/Tech-Stock-Prices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*

### Dataset: <ins>Cats in the UK</ins>
   * [R](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/TidyTuesday/blob/main/2023/01-31-23/UK-Cats.md) *(TidyTuesday)*
   * [Python](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/Python-Data-Science/blob/main/Cats%20UK.ipynb) *(Python-Data-Science)*

**Note: For the sake of practice, I tend to jump from one dataset to the next.**
