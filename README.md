- 👋 Hi, I’m @MattHondrakis
- 🧠 I’m interested in Probability/Statistics, Actuarial Science, and Data Science.
- 🌱 I received an Associate Data Sciencist Certification from DataCamp and Google Analytics Certificate from Google.
- :trophy: I have a BS in Applied Mathematics from The City College of New York.

### Datasets I found most interesting:   
  1. [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYCHousePrices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      * **GAM**, **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** models, predicting prices of Real Estate properties in NYC. The type of property (Condo, Apartment, etc.)           is extracted from the *home_details* variable, which plays a crucial role in the modeling process. Models are then compared against eachother by key metrics,           such as R<sup>2</sup> and Root Mean Squared Error.
  2. [Job Placement](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Masters%20Project%20Fall%20Placement/Masters-Project-Fall-Placement.md)  *(DataAnalysis)*
      *  Validated data by checking for and appropriately dealing with missing values and 
         outliers. Explored trends and correlations between different variables, displaying visualizations 
         and statistical tests. Afterwards, created two models (**Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression**) predicting whether an individual received a job offer 
         with the best model’s values for accuracy and AUC being 0.853 and 0.932, respectively. Finally, looked into the *variable importance* of each predictor in both models. 
  3. [Coursera Case Study: Bikes](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Coursera%20Case%20Study/Bikes.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      * Google Analytics Case Study (fictional company *Cyclistic*), analyzing a large dataset of more than **6 million** rows of data using R to extract insights. 
The purpose of the Case Study is to get casual users to convert to memberships. Thorough exploratory data analysis with a conclusion providing suggestions for improvement and steps moving forward.
  4. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)* **(one of the first real world dataset I worked on)**
      * **Logistic regression model** predicting whether a drink is a Frappuccino based on sodium (mg). The status of 'Frappuccino' is extracted 
        from the name of the drink using text manipulation.


Most Recent/Actively working on: 
* [Masters Final Project: Fall Placement](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Masters%20Project%20Fall%20Placement/Masters-Project-Fall-Placement.md) *(DataAnalysis)*


Note: I tend to jump from one dataset to the next!
