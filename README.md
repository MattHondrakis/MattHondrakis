# Datasets I found most interesting are:   
  1. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)*
      * **Logistic regression model** predicting whether a drink is a Frappuccino based on sodium (mg), accounting for size. The status of 'Frappuccino' is pulled 
        from the name of the drink.
  2. [Heart](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/01-06-22/heart.md)  *(First-Git)*
      * Comparison of 2 **logistic regression models**, predicting heart disease. One uses all variables as predictors and the second model uses the 4 most influential variables. 


Actively working on: 
   * [Crossword Puzzle](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/TidyTuesday/blob/main/04-19-22/Crossword-Puzzle.md)
   * [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYC-House-Prices.md)


I tend to jump from one dataset to the next!
