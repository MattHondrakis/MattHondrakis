- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MattHondrakis
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m interested in Probability/Statistics, Actuarial Science, and Data Science
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science on datacamp.com and receiving my BS in Applied Mathematics from City College of New York

### Datasets I found most interesting:   
  1. [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYC-House-Prices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*
      * **GAM**, **Random Forrest** and **Linear Regression** models, predicting prices of Real Estate properties in NYC. A good example of pulling information from data 
        by mutating columns. Models are then compared against eachother by key metrics, such as rsq and rmse.
  2. [Starbucks](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/12-21-21/Starbucks.md) *(First-Git)*
      * **Logistic regression model** predicting whether a drink is a Frappuccino based on sodium (mg), accounting for size. The status of 'Frappuccino' is pulled 
        from the name of the drink.
  3. [Heart](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/First-Git/blob/main/01-06-22/heart.md)  *(First-Git)*
      * Comparison of 2 **logistic regression models**, predicting heart disease. One uses all variables as predictors and the second model 
        uses the 4 most influential variables. 


Actively working on: 
   * [NYC House Prices](https://github.com/MattHondrakis/DataAnalysis/blob/main/NYC%20House%20Prices/NYC-House-Prices.md) *(DataAnalysis)*


Note: I tend to jump from one dataset to the next!
